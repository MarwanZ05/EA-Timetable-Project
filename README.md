# A project fulfilling the requirements of AI420: Evolutionary Algorithms
## Project Title: [2] Exam Timetabling Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

The purpose of this project was to independently compare different types of initialisation, crossover, mutation and survivor/parent selection, as well as observe the effects of diversity preservation methods (in our case, Shared Fitness) 

The following GA functions were used:

* Mutation:
  - Insert
  - Scramble
* Crossover:
  - Order
  - Cycle
* Parent Selection:
  - Exponential Rank
  - Fitness Proportionate
* Survivor Selection:
  - Mu, Lambda
  - Round Robin
* Initialisation:
  - Greedy
  - Random
* Diversity
  - Shared Fitness
